## 🔧 Integration in Your App

The system is already integrated into your QR code scanning app:

### Real-time Analytics Display
```typescript
// Shows live metrics in the main UI
<View style={styles.analyticsContainer}>
  <Text>Actions Today: {aiReporter.todayActionsCount}</Text>
  <Text>Active: {aiReporter.activeActions}</Text>
  <Text>Avg Time: {aiReporter.averageResponseTime}ms</Text>
</View>
```

### QR Code Tracking
```typescript
// Automatic tracking of QR code scans
const handleBarCodeScanned = async ({ type, data }) => {
  const tracker = await aiReporter.trackQRCodeScan(data);
  // ... processing ...
  await aiReporter.completeAction(tracker, true, undefined, {
    confidenceScore: 0.95
  });
};
```

### Report Dashboard
```typescript
// Full-featured reporting modal
<Modal visible={showReports}>
  <AIActionReportView
    onClose={() => setShowReports(false)}
    reportDays={7}
  />
</Modal>
```

## 📊 Sample Analytics Output

When you run QR code scans, the system automatically tracks:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "totalActions": 15,
    "successfulActions": 14,
    "failedActions": 1,
    "averageResponseTime": 245.5,
    "mostUsedActionType": "qr_code_analysis"
  },
  "analytics": {
    "actionsByType": {
      "qr_code_analysis": 12,
      "image_analysis": 3
    },
    "performanceMetrics": {
      "averageResponseTime": 245.5,
      "p95ResponseTime": 450.2,
      "errorRate": 0.067
    }
  }
